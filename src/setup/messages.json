        "message_body": "How you phrase your message depends on your desired effect—how you want your customers to feel, both about the text itself and your business in general. You might want to take a more serious tone if you own an elegant fine dining establishment, leaning more to full sentences with periods and a calmer presentation. A hip new takeaway catering largely to college-age students, on the other hand, might take a more informal approach, emojis and exclamation points optional.",

My wife had a burger over greens (gluten-free) which was also very good. They were very conscientious about gluten allergies. The restaurant has a vey nice ambiance and a cozy bar.” – HawaiiNut02760",
